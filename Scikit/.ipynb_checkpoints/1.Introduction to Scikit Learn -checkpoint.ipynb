    "# Machine Learning (ML):-\n",
    "A subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on creating algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make decisions or predictions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed for every specific task, machine learning systems identify patterns and insights from data to improve their performance over time.\n",

    "### **Key Components of Machine Learning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data**:\n",
    "   - The foundation of ML is data. Data can be structured (like tables in a database) or unstructured (like text, images, or videos).\n",
    "   - A dataset is typically divided into training, validation, and testing subsets:\n",
    "     - **Training Data**: Used to train the model.\n",
