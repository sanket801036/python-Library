    "## Seaborn Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scatter Plot\n",
    "- A scatter plot is a type of graph that uses dots to represent data points. Each dot's position on the horizontal and vertical axes represents its values for the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customizing with Matplotlib\n",
    "- Seaborn plots can be customized using Matplotlib functions and styles. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Box Plot\n",
    "- A box plot is a graphical representation of data that shows the distribution of the data. It shows the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Violin Plot\n",
    "- A violin plot is a graphical representation of data that shows the distribution of the data. It is similar to a box plot, but it also shows the density of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Swarm Plot\n",
    "- A swarm plot is a graphical representation of data that shows the distribution of the data. It is similar to a strip plot, but it uses jitter to avoid overlapping points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overlaying Plots\n",
    "- Seaborn allows you to overlay different types of plots on top of each other. This can be useful for comparing data or exploring relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heatmap\n",
    "- A heatmap is a graphical representation of data that uses color to represent values. It is often used to visualize relationships between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Histogram\n",
    "- A histogram is a graphical representation of data that shows the frequency of values in a dataset. It is often used to visualize the distribution of a single variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bar Plot\n",
    "- A bar plot is a graphical representation of data that uses bars to represent values. It is often used to compare values across different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factor Plot\n",
    "- A factor plot is a graphical representation of data that shows the relationship between two variables, one of which is categorical. It is often used to explore the effect of a categorical variable on a numerical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Density Plot\n",
    "- A density plot is a graphical representation of data that shows the distribution of a continuous variable. It is similar to a histogram, but it uses a smooth curve to represent the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joint Distribution\n",
    "- A joint distribution is a graphical representation of data that shows the relationship between two variables. It is similar to a scatter plot, but it also shows the marginal distributions of each variable.\n"
